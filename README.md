<h3>What is Proxygreator?</h3>

Proxygreator is a Visual Studio add-in that creates proxy webservice projects on the fly. 
It's a compound of "proxy" and "generator", proxygreator, get it?


<h3>What does it do exactly?</h3>

The project itself was created to automate proxy web service project generation process. It was created specifically for .NET environment since it generates MS Visual Studio projects with ready-to-run code. (Also it's a VS add-in, so there you go)


<h3>How does it work?</h3>

Install it, start it, type in WSDL content/provide the link of WSDL, press generate!


<h3>Installed it but couldn't found how to start it</h3>

It is located under "Tools" section in Visual Studio toolbar.
