- What is Proxygreator?
Proxygreator is a Visual Studio add-in that creates proxy webservice projects on the fly. 
It's a compound of "proxy" and "generator", proxygreator, get it?


- What does it do exactly?
The project itself was created to automate proxy web service project generation process. It was created specifically for .NET environment since it generates MS Visual Studio projects with ready-to-run code. (Also it's a VS add-in, so there you go)

Install it, start it, type in WSDL content/provide the link of WSDL, press generate!

It is located under "Tools" section in Visual Studio toolbar.
